# Auto Datasets â€” Seed Swarm

Automatic generation, upload, and sales tracking of **synthetic datasets** with metadata, fingerprints, and revenue logging.  
This workflow allows you to generate datasets for testing or modeling, upload them to **IPFS via Pinata**, and record each **real sale** in a JSON ledger.

---

## Quickstart

1. **Create a GitHub repository** and push all files:
   - `Generador.py` â€” generates high-quality synthetic datasets with metadata and file fingerprints.
   - `CargadorDePiÃ±ata.py` â€” securely uploads files and metadata to Pinata (IPFS).
   - `upload_to_huggingface.py` â€” publishes datasets and metadata to Hugging Face with reproducible structure and commercial traceability.
   - `AdministradorDeIngresos.py` â€” records real sales in `ledger.json`.

2. **Set up GitHub Secrets**:
   - `PINATA_API_KEY` â€” your Pinata API Key.
   - `PINATA_API_SECRET` â€” your Pinata API Secret.
   - `WALLET_ADDRESS` â€” your wallet address for sales logging.

   > Optional: `REINVEST_PERCENT` is no longer used since this workflow no longer reinvests; all revenue is fully recorded.

3. **Enable the automatic workflow**:
   - Runs on the schedule defined in `.github/workflows/auto_pipeline.yml`.
   - Can also be triggered manually using `workflow_dispatch`.

4. **Check the ledger**:
   - Every sale is recorded in `ledger.json` with timestamp, amount, source, and currency (`USD`).
   - Fully **real and transparent**, no simulation.

- All **datasets are synthetic**:  
  > `disclaimer`: `"THIS DATASET IS FULLY SYNTHETIC. NO REAL PERSONS OR ADDRESSES. FOR TESTING / MODELING ONLY."`
- Full **metadata** is generated with SHA256 fingerprint to ensure data integrity.
- No automatic reinvestment; **100% of revenue is under my control**.
- Keep your keys private and rotate any accidentally exposed credentials.
- Compatible with GitHub Actions, Replit, or any Python 3.11+ environment.

License
All datasets generated are synthetic. They contain no real personal data. They are intended for testing, modeling, and AI purposes only.

Commercial Use
All datasets are available for sale or license. Purchasers acknowledge that datasets are synthetic.
Revenue generated from these datasets is recorded and managed by the included automated pipeline.

Do not attempt to reverse-engineer or use the datasets for illegal purposes.

## Workflow Summary

1. `Generador.py` â†’ generates a `.jsonl.gz` dataset + `.meta.json`.
2. `CargadorDePiÃ±ata.py` â†’ uploads dataset and metadata to Pinata, stores the CIDs.
3. `AdministradorDeIngresos.py` â†’ logs each real sale into `ledger.json`.
4. GitHub Actions â†’ automates dataset generation, upload, and revenue logging.
5. Hugging Face account with API token
